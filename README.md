# RedM-VORP-Pack
This is Kamatcho's VORP Pack which is ready to launch

I am giving out "pre-build" server packs of the most common frameworks for RedM. There is nothing custom in here, just a little "Kama-Touch" to bugs or problems I encountered while assembling this pack. I just want to take away the hassle for people that don't want to search or assemble their own server. I understand most people don't know where to look, what to download, how to install and whatnot. I am here to try and make it a little bit easier for the not so nerdy people amongst us. 

Therefor this is also free and opensource. Just like the original files are. I take no credit whatsoever for these files and I'm also not the creator. You should check out the discord and people of the creators. 

## What do I need to do?
This is plug and play, the only thing you need to do yourself is get yourself some server files and get the server configuration running and that's about it. I will provide a resource.cfg in this pack including with a SQL file to make sure you have the correct information and database to work with these files. 

## Disclaimer
This might be outdated, as the creators of these packs are constantly working to keep their scripts up to date. I will try to keep these packs up to date with their work as much as possible, and keep these packs running to make it easier for people. 
If there is any problem concerning files or if you simply need me to set it up for you, you can visit my Fiverr page over at: [Kama's RedM Fiverr Page](https://nl.fiverr.com/lurzkamatcho/deliver-custom-solutions-for-your-redm-environment)
